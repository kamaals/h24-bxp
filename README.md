## Architecture

- Next.js as fullstack framework.
- Tailwind CSS for styling.
- PostgreSQL as database.
- Drizzle ORM for database interaction.
- BetterAuth for authentication.
- zod for types.
- RHF for form handling.
- UI components from Radix UI & Tanstack with ShadCN (headless UI)
  - Instead of Ant Design, I use Radix UI & Tanstack with ShadCN for UI components.
  - Reason is shadcn is more flexible and customizable than Ant Design.
  - Also, shadcn is more lightweight than Ant Design.
  - Ant Design is a bit heavy and not very flexible.
  - I personally prefer shadcn over Ant Design.
- Features: authentication, authorization, and login/logout
  - BetterAuth for authentication
  - Using next middleware for authorization
- Features: Category tree structure in UI
  - Using custom component to show user to tree structure
- Features: Category tree structure in DB
  - Using the same schema as parent category or null for root level category
- Features: Product category list in the UI
  - Use tan-stack table to display the list and for the pagination function
- Features: Product category list in the API/State
  - Use rtk query to fetch data from the API with pagination & category filter
- Features: Filter and Sort product list in the UI
  - Use tan-stack table coupled with rtk query to fetch data from the API?
  - Or directly let API to handle the filter and sort?
- Features: Show details of the product in the UI
  - use nextjs slot routing and interceptor to display the product details with fallback
- Features: Show the last modified product on top of the page.

  - Use DB trigger to update the last modified date? or use postgres realtime?

- TDD

  - Use jest and react testing library for unit test
  - Istanbul for coverage
  - Supertest for API testing

- Deployment

  - Use Vercel for deployment
  - DB is NeonDB
  - Use Github actions for CI/CD

- Local development
  - Use Docker for local development
  - Use postgres docker container
  - Use docker-compose to run the app and db
